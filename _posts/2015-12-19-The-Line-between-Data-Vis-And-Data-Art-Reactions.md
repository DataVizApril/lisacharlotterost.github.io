title: The Line between Data Vis and Data Art – Reactions
tag: datavis, thoughts,
---



Please notice: I cite people from comments(!) they left in 2009(!). They may have change their opinions and may have a completely other stance on the topic. I want to gather possible opinions here – who the bearer of the opinion was should play a second role. 

Another note: With "Data Art" I'll refer to "Information Art"; with "Data Vis" I'll refer to "Information Visualisation". The field still doesn't agree on definitions or differences of "Information Design" and "Data Visualisation" – for me, Data Vis refers to the design of numbers. Information Design refers to the design of "not-numbers" like processes, models, objects. 



**Data Art and Data Vis can learn from each other.**

Everybody agrees on that. 
Manuel Lima, 2009: "Even though a clear divide is necessary, it doesn’t mean that Information Visualization and Information Art cannot coexist. I would even argue they should, since they can learn a lot from each other and cross-pollinate ideas, methods and techniques."



**A divide is necessary, to help both fields.**

2009b, Manuel Lima: "The fallacy of Information Visualization being a conveyor of “pretty pictures” is drastically threatening the field, by undermining its goals and expectations. [...] We either try to restore the balance or we acknowledge a clearer divide. I do not think we can have a convoluted multipurpose all-encompassing practice. This will be detrimental to us all."

2009a, Manuel: "If we would aim for the best scenario it would certainly have a balanced proportion of both worlds - function and aesthetics – aiming at a useful, usable, legible, insightful, revealing, engaging and appealing execution. However, this type of virtuous outcome is not the norm. If it were, I wouldn’t be writing this manifesto. Lately it seems one end of the spectrum has been pulled in a much more sturdily way than the other. A key drive for this manifesto is to restore that balance."

2009, Kosara, https://eagereyes.org/criticism/shaking-the-pretty-picture-stigma: "I did write about possible criteria a while ago though, and think that the distinction is pretty clear. What is the main question: Do you want to communicate the data or a concern? Do you care about perceptual effectiveness or beauty? [...] Some people see a clear distinction between data visualization and data art as a threat, but I don’t see why that would be the case. There is nothing wrong with data art, it’s just not pragmatic data visualization. So let’s stop calling it that."

2010, Kosara, https://eagereyes.org/criticism/the-visualization-cargo-cult "There is a place for art, and there is a place for visualization. Mixing the two is difficult and dangerous, and often leads to things that are neither."

2009, Patricia McDonald, http://bbh-labs.com/do-not-glorify-aesthetics-a-manifesto-for-data-visualisation/ "Simply put, are we going to offer something that is either very, very useful or very, very beautiful? Either way, greater clarity of intent and greater discipline throughout the industry can only be an advantage in building credibility and engagement.""

**Data as Design-Material**

2009a,Moritz, "And this component I am missing from the manifesto: the capability of great information visualization to communicate on all levels of visual language - from the visual data representation to the evocative, look-and-feel, “between the lines” appeal of the work as a whole."


"how can you say that you still can't 'communicate' a message if it's not 'proper' dataviz?" – [Stefanie Posavec](https://twitter.com/stefpos/status/676747093059510272)

"just saying that just because someone uses data as a design material it doesn't consign it to the 'art' bin." [Stefanie Posavec](https://twitter.com/stefpos/status/676757185636995072)




Aesthetics vs. Understanding 

“Above all else, a visualization is beautiful when it is useful." - David J. Staley - Computers, Visualization, and History (2002), as cited by Manuel Lima (2009b)


Minor arguments: 
"Understanding"-Vis can lead to false insights, too.
Chart-Junk as "artistic" data vis.
Explorative vs. explanative Data vis 
Maybe it's a phrasing problem and we should give data vis or data art other names



2009b, Moritz Stefaner: "In fact, the discussion – as I experienced it – did not derail into “Aesthetics versus Function and Art versus Science”. In fact, my perception was that the strong reaction to the original manifesto was due to the fact that you explicitly introduced these dichotomies."





**Data Vis needs to be asthetical pleasing AND insightful (aka The middleground)**

2009b, Andrew Vande Moere: "...the middle ground. Those projects that are innovative enough to attract the attention from lay users, while powerful enough to lead to the discovery of insights."

2009a, Manuel: "Yes, there’s a strong overlap between Information Visualization and Information Art, and many practitioners will operate in that boundary. Jonathan Harris is a great example; another one that comes to mind is Mark Lombardi. Lombardi was considered an artist, yet his meticulous investigations, which resemble a painstaking scientific inquiry, were all about disclose and reveal."

2009a, Kim Rees: "Visualizations should be coherent, convey information, and be good looking. We can compare this to architecture. An architect may focus solely on the structure and not the aesthetic and fail. Or she may focus solely on the aesthetic not the structure and fail. It’s the great (and few) architects who excel at both who create the truly wonderful buildings. [...]  I believe aesthetics are crucial to a coherent visualization."




**It's just not possible to make the divide.**

Jer Thorp, 2009a: "Project by project, it may be possible to assign one label or another, but there will always be work that doesn’t fit in one mold or another. Similarly, there will be individuals & groups who will operate most effectively by straddling this border. This is a good thing."



**A divide doesn't benefit anybody.**

 "how about we simply judge individual works in terms of what they achieve?" – [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner/status/676520605643067393) & "I just want to make sure that people understand that with each project, you can position yourself in that space." [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner/status/676698811092324352)

  "That's the crux of the discussion. What is gained? What is lost? Hard lines? Soft gradients?" – [Raphaël de Courville](https://twitter.com/sableRaph/status/676698128536481792)








Meaning + Beauty in Data Vis and Data Art

![image](/pic/151220_DataVisDataArt.png)

My last blog post let to a great, great debate on Twitter with great, great people. Thanks to everybody who attended and made me learn something new! Eg that in 2009, Manuel Lima wrote a Manifesto in which he touched the "divide between Information Art and Information Design, and which let to almost exactly the same debate that I had on Twitter. The points made reached from: **A divide is necessary, to help both fields.** to **A divide doesn't benefit anybody.** and **It's not possible to make the divide.** 

I stumbled across one point in this debate which I've met a few times so far: **A data vis needs to be beautiful to be insightful**. For example, Kim Rees noted in [her comment on the Manifesto](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/blog/?p=644): 
	"Visualizations should be coherent, convey information, and be good looking. We can compare this to architecture. An architect may focus solely on the structure and not the aesthetic and fail. Or she may focus solely on the aesthetic not the structure and fail. It’s the great (and few) architects who excel at both who create the truly wonderful buildings. [...]  I believe aesthetics are crucial to a coherent visualization."

I think she's right, but it actually works in favour of thinking that "A divide is necessary, to help both fields", as I do. I want to extend on her point and result in a claim for more data art.

Aesthetics can certainly serve the understanding of a visualisation – to structure the content in a better way, make it better readable or get the reader's attention in the first place. But in my opinion, **aesthetics can serve the understanding only to a certain degree**. Meaning, an insightful chart which is ugly as hell is worse than an insightful chart which is well readable because of added aesthetics. But an insightful chart with too much focus on aesthetics and visual innovation (and therefore bad readabilty) is a worse chart than the ugly, insightful chart. There's a dangerous threshold that shouldn't be crossed. If a bar chart is the most graspable way to design a dataset, choosing a circular visualisation will increase aesthetics, but will decrease understanding. In a formula: 


**Beauty that increases Meaning > Meaning without Beauty > Beauty that decreases Meaning**

or, extremely broken down:

**Meaning + Beauty > just Meaning > just Beauty**. 

BUT that formula is only true when talking about data visualisation and their purpose of being insightful. **In Data ART, aesthetics CAN and sometimes SHOULD be the first priority**. "Too much aesthetics" or "just beauty" can be a good thing. Not being dependent on the understanding anymore will make the visual experience enourmously better – and it will make circular visualisations look like a dull compromise. An example: I find some [NYT](www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html?abt=0002&abg=1) and [Periscopic](http://www.periscopic.com/) charts visually pleasing – and I'm glad they are, because it helps to convey the data. But [Jorinde Voigt](http://jorindevoigt.com/blog/?cat=55)? WOAH. Her images blows my mind! "The data itself is [...] not important for the message, but serves [...] to communicate a higher, sublime experience.", I wrote about the work of Jorinde Voigt a few years ago in an university essay.

Yes, art is not only about aesthetics. Got it. But most people get attracted to the field by exactly that: The aesthetical side of data vis. They like that data vis combines data (aka "the serious stuff" and sometimes an accessible way for them to get in touch with aesthetics) with vis (aka "something pretty"). But that results in **an overhang of data vis which tries too hard to be beautiful to be meaningful**.

I want these people to discover data art. To stand to their love of data aesthetics and to not sell their data art as data vis anymore. To get rid of compromises. To say openly: **"Yes, this data vis piece doesn't tell you anything about the data points. My aim was a different one."** Only then we can have an honest conversation about how to improve their work. To make that happen, it's important to regognize data art as valuable. As Jer Thorp said in 2009a: "I’d argue that work that might get classified as Information Art should be considered to be as serious and as important as that which gets labelled as Information Visualization."
