My last blog post let to a great, great debate on Twitter with great, great people. Thanks to everybody who attended and made me learn something new! Eg that in 2009, Manuel Lima wrote a Manifesto in which he touched the "divide between Information Art and Information Design, and which let to almost exactly the same debate that I had on Twitter. The points made reached from: **A divide is necessary, to help both fields.** to **A divide doesn't benefit anybody.** and **It's not possible to make the divide.** 

I stumbled across one point in this debate which I've met a few times so far: **A data vis needs to be beautiful to be insightful**. For example, Kim Rees noted in [her comment on the Manifesto](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/blog/?p=644): 
	"Visualizations should be coherent, convey information, and be good looking. We can compare this to architecture. An architect may focus solely on the structure and not the aesthetic and fail. Or she may focus solely on the aesthetic not the structure and fail. It’s the great (and few) architects who excel at both who create the truly wonderful buildings. [...]  I believe aesthetics are crucial to a coherent visualization."

I think she's right, but it actually works in favour of thinking that "A divide is necessary, to help both fields", as I do. I want to extend on her point and result in a claim for more data art.

Aesthetics can certainly serve the understanding of a visualisation – to structure the content in a better way, make it better readable or get the reader's attention in the first place. But in my opinion, **aesthetics can serve the understanding only to a certain degree**. Meaning, an insightful chart which is ugly as hell is worse than an insightful chart which is well readable because of added aesthetics. But an insightful chart with too much focus on aesthetics and visual innovation (and therefore bad readabilty) is a worse chart than the ugly, insightful chart. There's a dangerous threshold that shouldn't be crossed. If a bar chart is the most graspable way to design a dataset, choosing a circular visualisation will increase aesthetics, but will decrease understanding. In a formula: 


**Beauty that increases Meaning > Meaning without Beauty > Beauty that decreases Meaning**

or, extremely broken down:

**Meaning + Beauty > just Meaning > just Beauty**. 

BUT that formula is only true when talking about data visualisation and their purpose of being insightful. **In Data ART, aesthetics CAN and sometimes SHOULD be the first priority**. "Too much aesthetics" or "just beauty" can be a good thing. Not being dependent on the understanding anymore will make the visual experience enourmously better – and it will make circular visualisations look like a dull compromise. An example: I find some [NYT](www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html?abt=0002&abg=1) and [Periscopic](http://www.periscopic.com/) charts visually pleasing – and I'm glad they are, because it helps to convey the data. But [Jorinde Voigt](http://jorindevoigt.com/blog/?cat=55)? WOAH. Her images blows my mind! "The data itself is [...] not important for the message, but serves [...] to communicate a higher, sublime experience.", I wrote about the work of Jorinde Voigt a few years ago in an university essay.

Yes, art is not only about aesthetics. Got it. But most people get attracted to the field by exactly that: The aesthetical side of data vis. They like that data vis combines data (aka "the serious stuff" and sometimes an accessible way for them to get in touch with aesthetics) with vis (aka "something pretty"). But that results in **an overhang of data vis which tries too hard to be beautiful to be meaningful**.

I want these people to discover data art. To stand to their love of data aesthetics and to not sell their data art as data vis anymore. To get rid of compromises. To say openly: **"Yes, this data vis piece doesn't tell you anything about the data points. My aim was a different one."** Only then we can have an honest conversation about how to improve their work. To make that happen, it's important to regognize data art as valuable. As Jer Thorp said in 2009a: "I’d argue that work that might get classified as Information Art should be considered to be as serious and as important as that which gets labelled as Information Visualization."
