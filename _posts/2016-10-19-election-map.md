The US election year goes on and on and on, and lots of us have followed Election Forecasts like [FiveThirtyEight's](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=2016-forecast) one closely. In fact, every publisher out there has an own version of an election map, and all of them have different approaches:

I'm very happy they exist. Especially [FiveThirtyEight](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=2016-forecast) and the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html) did a great job at showing the forecasts from different points of views, in different charts.

What I've been missing in all these charts is the popular vote. Both FiveThirtyEight and the New York Times focus on the "chance to win". And of course, that's the most important number. But for a foreigner like me, it's hard to understand the difference between the "chance to win" and how many people want to vote for a candidate. Right now, Hillary Clinton has a 90% chance to win, but less than half of the US population plan to vote for her, according to the polls.

Most of the election maps show the electoral votes; but I'm afraid that some people might not read them this way. When I look at New York or California on such a map, I see states in which everybody will vote for Clinton. When I look at Wyoming or Alabama, I see states in which everybody will vote for Trump. On the map, these states are bright blue and bright red.

If you'll dig a level deeper on FiveThirtyEight, you'll find that of the 20 million people in New York, [7 million](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/new-york/) plan to vote for Trump. And in Wyoming, ["only" 60%](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/wyoming/) of the population will vote for Trump.

If you map the popular vote instead of the elect votes, you'll represent these numbers in this far more diverse picture:

Of course, thanks to the "Winner takes it all" system, the electoral maps and the "chance to win" show far better who will actually be president. **But I'm afraid that these maps can have a huge negative influence on our collective stereotypes.** We should be aware that there are lots of Trump voters in the most democratic states, and lots of Clinton voters in the most republican ones. We can't just put the whole state population in one box and put a red or blue label on it.

In addition, these maps might have an negative effect on the voter turnout. **Approximately half of the population can't find themselves and their planned vote on an electoral map**. No wonder that there are voters who claim that their vote "doesn't matter".

In my opinion **it's important to show both: A map with the popular vote, and a map with the electoral votes.** In the best case, this can lead to some nice side-effect education about the US election system.

It's important to note that I'm coming from a foreigner's perspective. Maybe I would see things differently if I had grown up in the US, experiencing lots of elections and experiencing far more of the country. In fact, I got so confused by the difference between the popular vote and the electoral votes that I built myself an explainer. I'm aware that it doesn't quite work for Maine and Nebraska, and some numbers might be off. See it as a design draft. [But please let me know](mailto:lisacharlotterost@gmail.com) if you find a major mistake, or if you know of maps that show the popular vote.
